First quest: find average age by party

congress_age %>%
mutate(year = format(termstart, "%Y")) %>%
filter(party %in% c("R", "D")) %>%
group_by(year, party)
summarize(avg_age = mean(age))


mutate creates new columns
summarize decreases the number of rows

click on file, project
don't put .Rproj on github it's private!

Rubin Causal Model: A Monologue
Harvard measures employee satisfaction from 1 to 10 (low to high)
Wants to increase satisfaction -- give more CC

Units, outcomes
Treatment = new thing
Control = base case
Causal Effect of the treatment can be quantified

Can only see one state of the world is a drawback. You either get the CC or you don't. So, add more people to survey.

How can we estimate the causal effect of Crimson Cash on employee satisfaction?

Average across control and treatment and find the difference to estimate causal effect.

Milestone 2 is due on Friday! 

to get a date file into your "files" workspace, download it and move it around:
mv file-pathway place-you-want-it
Or, to expedite things, just use a "." to say "move this thing here!"

this may end up looking like:
mv ~/Downloads/class_enrollment_summary_by_term_9.17.19.xlsx .

say "<-" as "get"

library(readxl) 
read_xlsx is the command to use
you can couple this with "skip = x" to remove that number of rows from the top in the event that they're empty
